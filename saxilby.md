# Saxilby Ringing Simulator

The Saxilby ringing simulator comes with a (magnetic?) position sensor .
The sensor is wired with a short cable that has an AV end, and there's a long AV-to-serial cable, and a serial-to-USB cable.
The sensor data needs to make its way to the ringing software on the computer so, as supplied, there needs to be a route for the sensor wiring to run from the Saxilby wheel to the computer.

The Saxilby manufacturer does not provide a wireless sensor option. However, it should be possible to pass sensor data wirelessly. There are at least two options:

1. Wireless serial adaptor

This option uses the existing sensor, but adds a wireless adapter to send the data to the computer over wifi.

2. SIMBELL wireless ringing sensors

This option does not use the existing sensor. Instead the Saxilby would have a reflector stuck to the bell and a wireless SIMBELL transmitter would be attached to the frame, while the computer would be plugged into a wireless SIMBELL receiver.
